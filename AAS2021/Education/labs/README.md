# Astronomy lab actvities with SDSS notebooks

These activities were originally created to support an upper-level undergraduate lab course for astronomy majors at the University of North Carolina Asheville. They are designed to equip university students with the basic skills to perform astronomy research with large datasets. 

## Gettting started

To start using these notebooks, first copy the entire **SciServer_notebooks** folder from here into your **Storage/{username}/persistent/** folder, using the Copy button in the Dashboard Files view, so you can save your changes. Then, go to [SciServer Compute](https://apps.sciserver.org/compute/) and create a new container (virtual compute environment) using the *SciServer Essentials* Compute image and mounting your *persistent* and *scratch* user volumes. Click on the name of your new container to open it, navigate to */Storage/{username}/persistent/Scierver_notebooks/*, and open a notebook.

They can be used in a sequence of 2-hour lab sessions for half of a 12-week semester, leaving the second half of the semester for guided independent research.  

**An example course structure using these notebooks is provided below:**

- Week 1: An introduction to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (see the [included slides](SciServer_notebooks/Week1_SDSSintro_brief.pdf))
- Week 2: Introduction to Python
- Week 3: Data visualization and Querying the SDSS Database
- Week 4: Visualizing and Modeling H-R Diagrams
- Week 5: Building a Sample for Citizen Science with Galaxy Zoo
- Week 6: Spectroscopic Identification and Redshift Determination
- Weeks 7-12: Reserved for guided independent research  (see the [example projects document](SciServer_notebooks/Project_descriptions_SDSSEPO.pdf))

The notebooks use Python 3, but they could be modified to use R.

These activities were created by Prof. Britt Lundgren of the University of North Carolina Asheville.
