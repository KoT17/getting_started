# Big Data Clusters

Big Data Clusters [BDC](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/big-data-cluster/big-data-cluster-overview?view=sql-server-ver15) is a bundled Microsoft solution that enables querying data across large distributed stores via T-SQL and Spark interfaces.

At SciServer, together with Microsoft, we are evaluating BDC for a variety of use-cases, including in astronomy. We have demos for SDSS Manga data and for a 3+TB ZTF dataset we have obtained for evaluation purposed. If you are interested in learning more, or have a use-case of your own, please come talk to us!
