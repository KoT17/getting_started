# Future directions and features

The demo notebooks in this section are of some in-development features being developed at SciServer. As technology evolves, so do we and we are happy to support science in the increasingly data and computation intensive world in which we live. 

Because they are currently in development, users cannot access these features by default at the moment. We would love to go over the demo notebooks in person and/or discuss potential use cases for considering early access - so please contact us!
