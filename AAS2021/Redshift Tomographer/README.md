<h1>The Tomographer</h1>

http://tomographer.org/

The Tomographer is a tool for exploring the third dimension (or redshift distribution) of any source catalog or sky map, using the clustering-redshift technique.
It allows one to explore virtually any dataset: at any wavelength and over a wide range of angular resolutions. The larger the footprint, the better. It is designed to be as simple as possible for the user: simply upload a source catalog or a Healpix intensity map and the Tomographer will infer its redshift distribution.

SciServer provides the infrastructure for launching computational jobs that generate the tomography, as well as the storage space needed for the application and tomography results.
