<h1>The Sequencer</h1>

http://sequencer.org/

The Sequencer is a web interface for users to upload a dataset and run an algorithm designed to automatically reveal the main trend or sequence in the dataset, if it exists. To do so, it reorders the collection of dataset objects to produce the most elongated manifold describing their similarities estimated in a multi-scale and multi-metric manner. This process can generically reveal the main trend in arbitrary datasets.

SciServer provides the infrastructure for launching computational jobs that sequence the user-uploaded datasets, as well as the storage space needed for the application and sequenced results.
