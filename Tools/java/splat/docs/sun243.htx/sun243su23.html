<!--l. 3045--><p class="noindent" >This window allows you to change the coordinate or data units of the current spectrum to a limited
number of preset values. You can only change units when the current spectrum already has a correctly
set coordinate system or data units.
<!--l. 3050--><p class="noindent" >If you need to set the coordinates or data units you must use the two toolboxes available in the main
window. These also offer considerably more flexibility, particularly when defining spectral
coordinates.
<!--l. 3054--><p class="noindent" >If you do not want to change the units of an axis, just leave the value set at <b>Not set or
unrecognised</b>.
<!--l. 3057--><p class="noindent" >When you see the value <b>Not set or unrecognised</b>, that means that the current spectrum has no
properly defined coordinates or data units for that axis (as appropriate), or, that the settings do not
match one of the pre-defined set that you can switch to. Note that data units which match one of the
preset values dimensionally will be displayed in the preset format, so may not match values shown
elsewhere, say in the plot labels.
<!--l. 3064--><p class="noindent" >When the plot is displaying more than one spectrum, only the current one is actually modified. If you
want the other spectra to be drawn as if in the same coordinates or data units, then you must make
sure that the menu item <b>Options-&#x003E;Match coordinates and/or fluxes</b> is selected, but this will
only work when all the displayed spectra have proper spectral coordinates and data units
defined.
<!--l. 3071--><p class="noindent" >The <b>SideBand:</b> control is for switching between sidebands (upper and lower) when display spectra
that are derived from a dual sideband instrument. This is not available when your spectra do not have
this feature. When displaying a dual sideband spectrum the inactive sideband coordinates will be
displayed along the unused X axis (usually the top). You can also use this control to display
coordinates offset from the Local Oscillator value.
<!--l. 3079--><p class="noindent" >The <b>Origin:</b> control allows you to display offset coordinates. In this case you can select
to have no offset (<b>None</b>), use the existing offset, if defined (<b>Default</b>, usually the same as
<b>None</b>), or display coordinates offset from the rest frequency. Note for velocities this last
option isn&#x2019;t useful as they are already displayed offset from this value. If you want to set
another value as the origin then you need to use the advanced toolbox available in the main
window.
<!--l. 3087--><p class="noindent" >The <b>Standard of rest:</b> control allows you to switch between the various supported rest
frames. If the current spectrum doesn&#x2019;t support these the value will be set to <b>Not set or
unrecognised</b>.
                                                                                       
                                                                                       
<!--l. 3091--><p class="noindent" >The <b>Rest Frequency:</b> field displays the current rest frequency in <b>GHz</b>. This can be changed in two
ways, either by selecting a position along the plot X axis, which you start by pressing the
<b>Pick pos</b> button and then clicking on the plot, or by selecting a line identifier, which you
do by pressing the <b>Pick ID</b> button and clicking on the plot in the vicinity of the desired
label. When picking a line identifier the rest frequency is set to that of the line, not of the
position that it currently occupies on the plot (these will differ if the spectrum has a source
velocity).
