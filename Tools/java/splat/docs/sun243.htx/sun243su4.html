<!--l. 439--><p class="noindent" ><b>Global list of spectra</b>
     <div class="quote">
     <!--l. 441--><p class="noindent" >In the <b>Global list of spectra</b> short names for each5 spectra are shown. The short
     names are intended to allow the quick identification of spectra and can be modified
     at any time by selecting the name and then typing a new name in the <b>Short name</b>
     field  (remember  to  press  <code>&#x003C;Return&#x003E;</code> to  make  the  change  happen).  Initially  short
     names are read from the <code>TITLE</code> or <code>OBJECT</code> properties of spectral data formats that
     support these (<em>i.e.</em>&#x00A0;NDF and FITS respectively), otherwise they default to the file
     name.
     <!--l. 451--><p class="noindent" >Another important concept related to the global list, is using it to create a selected
     range or list of the spectra. Selection is important as this identifies which spectra
     you&#x2019;d like to see properties for, or want to work with. There&#x2019;s a quick tutorial on
     <a 
href="sun243su2.html#x7-60002">selecting spectra</a> in the introductory material (&#x00A7;<a 
href="sun243su2.html#x7-60002">2.2<!--tex4ht:ref: selecting_spectra --></a>).</div>
<!--l. 459--><p class="noindent" ><b>Properties of current spectra</b>
     <div class="quote">
     <!--l. 461--><p class="noindent" >In the properties area there are controls for changing how the currently selected
     spectra  are  displayed  (a  spectrum  always  uses  the  same  display  properties)  and
     where they are displayed.
     <!--l. 465--><p class="noindent" >If more than one spectrum is selected then the properties shown are those of the
     first spectrum (<em>i.e.</em>&#x00A0;highest in the global list). However, any changes that you then
     make are applied to all the selected spectra.
     <!--l. 469--><p class="noindent" >If you load a table into <span class="sf">SPLAT-VO </span>&#x00A0;the <b>Columns:</b> controls will show the names of
     the columns selected. If these are incorrect then you can choose a different set.
                                                                                       
                                                                                       
     <!--l. 473--><p class="noindent" >The properties that you can change include the colour (press on this to get a swatch
     of selectable colours), the composite value (that is the transparency so you can see
     lines or points through other line or points), the line type (simple connected polyline
     or histogram, or just a point marker). If you choose to draw lines then you can set
     the width and style (dashed <em>etc.</em>). If you choose to draw points then various types
     are available.
     <!--l. 480--><p class="noindent" >If the selected spectra have errors then you can display error bars by clicking on the
     <b>Error bars:</b> control. This is greyed out if errors are not available. The colour, number
     of sigma drawn and frequency of the error bars can be changed using the other
     controls on this line.

<!--l. 487--><p class="noindent" ><b>Views of current spectra</b>
     <div class="quote">
     <!--l. 489--><p class="noindent" >The  views  of  the  current  spectra  region  shows  the  names  of  the  plots  that  are
     displaying the currently selected spectra (this time if a plot is showing only some
     of the spectra, then it is highlighted in red). To add a spectrum or list of spectra to
     a plot, select their names in the global list and then click on the <b>Displayed</b> control
     (normally this results in a tick appearing). If a plot is already displaying some of
     the selected spectra then you force it to display them all by clicking twice &#x2013; the first
     click removes the selected spectra and the second puts them all back, plus the ones
     not already shown.
     <!--l. 499--><p class="noindent" >To make a plot visible double click on its name. This should raise and deiconify it.</div>
<!--l. 503--><p class="noindent" ><b>Toolbar and menus</b>
     <div class="quote">
     <!--l. 505--><p class="noindent" >The toolbar region has a series of buttons that act as short-cuts to many of the
     functions found in the main menus. Here&#x2019;s a quick break down of what they
     do:
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize"><img 
src="openfile.gif" alt="PIC"  
>  Create an open file dialogue. You can use this to browse any local files and
     select a list of them for opening. When opened they are added to the global
     list and displayed in a new plot (unless you untick the <b>Display</b> control). You
     may open files that are already in the global list, this just creates a new entry.
     Normally the type of a spectrum is determined using the file extension, but
     using this dialogue you can select a type, or ask that it be guessed.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize"><img 
src="location.gif" alt="PIC"  
>  Download and display a spectrum from the Internet. If you have a URL
     for a spectrum to view then use this simple dialog.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize"><img

>  Query any known Simple Spectral Access Protocol (SSAP) servers about
     spectra that they hold on a region of the sky and download these to <span class="sf">SPLAT-VO

     </li>
     <li class="itemize"><img 
src="browse.gif" alt="PIC"  
>   Browse a hierarchy of files. This dialogue can be used like the open file
     dialogue to choose a file containing a spectrum, but, it also allows you to look
     inside a file for any displayable components. This is useful for FITS files that
     contain extensions (spectral or table extensions can be opened), or HDS files
     that contain more than one NDF. The file type guessing used here is the same
     as that used when you set a type of <code>guess</code> (either on the command-line or by
     using the open file dialogue).

     you can select them in the global list get them opened. Note that not all spectra are
     backed by a suitable disk-file, these types will be ignored.

     <li class="itemize"><img 
src="savefile.gif" alt="PIC"  
>  Create a save file dialogue. Using this you can save a spectrum to disk-file. There
     are no restrictions on which file format you can save to, but information may be lost

     energy and velocity. Unit information can be used to align spectra in a plot
     (so you can trivially compare spectra in say angstroms and nanometres,
     energy and frequency or even heliocentric and topocentric rest frames
     <em>etc.</em>).

>  Open a window to set the data units of any spectra. This can be useful when

     spectra between flux systems when they are drawn (making them correctly
     aligned).
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">  View the FITS headers of any selected spectra. A window displaying the headers
     will be opened for each of the selected spectra. Note that only 1D FITS and NDFs

     not.

     <!--l. 607--><p class="noindent" >Interesting menu items not found in the toolbar are a list of standard line position
     catalogues (for optical and some IR and submillimeter lines), these are found in
     <b>Options-&#x003E;Line identifiers</b>. Others are to do with controlling the selection of the spectra
     and plots (see the <b>Edit</b> menu, just like deleting spectra from the global list you can delete
     all the selected plots) and changing the &#x2018;look and feel&#x2019; of <span class="sf">SPLAT-VO </span>. These options are
     found in the <b>Options-&#x003E;Look and Feel</b> and <b>Options-&#x003E;Colour Theme</b> sub-menus. Note that
     if you select the CDE/Motif look and feel you cannot change the colour and fonts
     used.
     <!--l. 617--><p class="noindent" >You can also save and restore the global stack of spectra to and from diskfile using a special

     <span class="sf">SPLAT-VO </span>&#x00A0;will check for any spectral coordinate system in the input spectra and use that,
     if the default coordinate system isn&#x2019;t spectral. It will also use any units it can locate to
     attempt a guess if all else fails. Unfortunately this means that if you intend to
     view another coordinate system (like GRID to see the channel numbers), it
     might fail, so switching this off gives you complete control. This option can
