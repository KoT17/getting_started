<!--l. 660--><p class="noindent" >The anatomy of a plot window is shown below:
<div class="center">
<img

> </div>
<!--l. 664--><p class="noindent" >It has three main regions, the menubar &#x0026; toolbar, the control panel and the display area.<br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 667--><p class="noindent" ><b>The display area</b>
     <div class="quote">
     <!--l. 669--><p class="noindent" >The display area shows a view of all the spectra that are currently associated with
     this plot. The colours, plotting style <em>etc.</em>&#x00A0;of these spectra are determined by their
     global properties as set in the main browser window.
     <!--l. 674--><p class="noindent" >The  plot  title  and  axis  labels  are  determined  using  the  properties  of  the  current
     spectrum,  if  possible.  For  instance  if  the  current  spectrum  is  an  NDF  then  these
     values are determined from the NDF&#x2019;s title, units and axis components, or for more
     recent  NDFs  from  the  properties  of  its  WCS  component.  Similarly  for  FITS  files
     these values are determined using the world coordinates FITS keywords. To change
     these look in the <b>Configure Plot Options</b> window, which is activated by pressing
     the <img 
src="config.gif" alt="PIC"  
>  button.
     <!--l. 683--><p class="noindent" >The  size  of  the  area  used  to  display  a  spectrum  is  initially  determined  from  an
     automatic  match  of  its  data  and  coordinate  extents  to  the  visible  surface  of  the
     display area, you can change the size of the display surface using the zoom controls
     described below and/or you can change the actual data limits using the <b>Configure
     Plot Options</b> window. When you add or remove a spectrum the apparent size of
     the display region stays the same and all the spectra now displayed are scaled to fit
     within it. To return to a state where the visible surface matches the display area you
     need to press the <img 
src="fitwidth.gif" alt="PIC"  
>  and <img 
src="fitheight.gif" alt="PIC"  
>  buttons.
     <!--l. 693--><p class="noindent" >The <b>Configure Plot Options</b> window also offers the ability change the colour of the
     display area background, to draw the lines using anti-aliasing (which reduces the
     jagged effects, but at the cost of drawing speed), to modify the reserved area around
     the plot and do things like position the numeric labels, set the axis gaps <em>etc.</em>&#x00A0;
                                                                                       
                                                                                       
     <!--l. 699--><p class="noindent" >The following interactions are provided in the display area.
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">Continuous coordinate and data readout: when you move the mouse pointer
     over the display area the coordinates and data value of the nearest point of the
     current spectrum are shown in the control panel. If the readout is not updating
     you have probably moved outside of the extent of the current spectrum (the
     one selected in the <b>Displaying:</b> control).
     <!--l. 708--><p class="noindent" >If the vertical hair is enabled, then this also follows the mouse pointer.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Region Zoom: you can zoom on a feature by dragging a rectangle over it using
     the middle mouse button.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Incremental Zoom: you can increase the zoom factors by one simply by pressing
     the middle mouse button anywhere in the display area or pressing the <!--l. 716--><math

     keys. If you hold down the shift key these zoom in Y, otherwise in X.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Scrollbars:  when  the  X  or  Y  zooms  make  the  plot  greater  in  size  than  the
     display area scrollbars appear to the bottom and right. Just drag the sliders to
     scroll.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Keyboard Scroll: the arrows keys can be made to control the scroll, provided
     the keyboard focus is in the display area. Make sure of this by clicking the left
     mouse button while pointed in the display area.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Interpolated data value: if the keyboard focus is in the display area and the
     vertical hair is shown, then pressing the space bar will display the interpolated
     position of the hair, rather than the X coordinate and data value of the nearest
     position in the spectrum.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Interactive graphics control: if any interactive graphics figures are shown (such
     as those that define ranges for fitting backgrounds and spectral lines, or are
     produced by the controls in the <b>Graphics</b> menu), then these can be moved by
     selecting them (just click on one and little grips appear around the edges) and
     then dragging them and resized by dragging the edge grips.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Drop target: you can drop any spectra dragged from the global list and they
     will be displayed.

<!--l. 747--><p class="noindent" ><b>The control panel</b>
     <div class="quote">
     <!--l. 749--><p class="noindent" >The control panel area provides controls for interacting with the plot. It also shows
     details of what spectra are displayed in the plot and a continuous readout of the X
     coordinate and corresponding data value.
                                                                                       
                                                                                       
     <!--l. 754--><p class="noindent" >The <b>Displaying:</b> drop down list shows the names and current rendering properties
     of any spectra that are displayed. If you choose a spectrum from this list it becomes
     the  <b>current  spectrum</b>  and  is  used  as  the  basis  for  the  plot&#x2019;s  coordinates  (so  the
     readouts now show the values of this spectrum, also the plot will be re-drawn if
     the  coordinate  system  of  the  newly  selected  spectrum  is  different).  The  selected
     spectrum also becomes selected in the browser window (so you see its details more
     clearly and apply modifications). This spectrum is also the one used by any tools
     (such  as  background  and  line  fitting)  that  work  with  only  one  spectrum.  If  you
     remove this spectrum using the <b>Edit-&#x003E;Remove current spectrum</b> option then the
     next spectrum in the list becomes the current one.
     <!--l. 767--><p class="noindent" >The  <b>Y  limits  (%):</b>  drop  down  list  provides  a  series  of  quick  cuts  for  setting  the
     limits of the Y axis. Normally this is the full range, but using a percentage cut can
     usefully clip the range to reject extreme outlier data values. The data values used
     are restricted to the limits of then X coordinates (all when automatic ranging is used,
     the default ).
     <!--l. 774--><p class="noindent" >The <b>Wavelength:</b> entry control has two functions. The first is to show the current
     wavelength.  The  second  is  to  allow  you  to  centre  the  display  area  on  a  specific
     coordinate. Just type in the value you want to see here and press <code>&#x003C;Return&#x003E;</code>. Note
     that the label of this area modifies to match the label of the X axis, so could say
     something different to <b>Wavelength:</b>.
     <!--l. 781--><p class="noindent" >The <b>:V-hair</b> checkbox controls whether the &#x2018;vertical hair&#x2019; is shown. The vertical hair
     is just a vertical line that follows the mouse pointer around the display area. It can
     be quite slow, so isn&#x2019;t shown by default.
     <!--l. 786--><p class="noindent" >The <b>X scale:</b> and <b>Y scale:</b> controls change the zoom of the display area. The plus
     and minus controls increase and decrease the zoom by one, or you can choose a
     zoom from the drop-down lists, or you can type in a decimal value (which should
     be greater than equal to one) and press <code>&#x003C;Return&#x003E;</code>.
     <!--l. 792--><p class="noindent" >The <b>:log</b> controls determine if either of the axes are drawing using log spacing (this
     is not possible if either axis spans the value zero. In this case, the user is notified
     and asked if a copy of the plot with such values removed should be created). Finer
     control of the log spacing and labelling can be obtained using the plot configuration
     window. If there are values
     <!--l. 798--><p class="noindent" >The  <b>Track  free</b>  checkbox  determines  what  values  are  shown  in  the  continuous
     coordinate  readouts.  When  unchecked  (the  default)  the  values  shown  are  the
     nearest  ones  of  the  current  spectrum  to  the  pointer  position.  When  checked  the
     readouts show the coordinates under the pointer.

     <div class="quote">
     <!--l. 807--><p class="noindent" >The  toolbar  region  has  a  series  of  buttons  that  act  as  short-cuts  to  most  of  the
     functions  found  in  the  main  menus.  Some  of  these  create  new  windows  with
     complex actions that should be consulted for further help.

     account. If you want to do otherwise select this item.

     <li class="itemize"><b>Options-&#x003E;Match  using  base  system</b>  When  matching  spectra  it  is  usual  to
     achieve this by transforming all coordinate systems into a common system,
     this system is wavelength by default. For some systems it may be better to use
     another common system so by selecting this option you can set the common

     <li class="itemize"><b>Options-&#x003E;Only display grid axes in visible area</b> Normally the labelled axes
     displaying the spectral and data coordinates are drawn to the full size of the
     display surface of the plot. This is the quickest mode as it reduces the need for
     re-drawing. If you select this option the axes will be only drawn within the the
     visible part of the plot, which makes it easier to see the coordinate labels, but
     means that the axes need to be re-drawn continually when scrolling.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize"><b>Options-&#x003E;Only display spectra within axes</b> Select this option if you only want
     spectra (including line identifiers) to be drawn within the bounds of the axes.
     When combined with the previous option to only display axes in the visible
     area this will potentially slow down scroll operations a lot, so the default is off.

     you have opened yourself), and whose coordinate ranges fall within that of the

     the plot. Note that this will not work if the spectra displayed in the plot do not
     have defined spectral coordinates.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize"><b>Options-&#x003E;Line identifiers-&#x003E;Positions track current spectrum</b> If you select this
     option then line identifiers that do not have data positions (this is typically
     true) will be positioned above the current spectrum, rather than displayed in a
     line along the bottom of the plot.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize"><b>Options-&#x003E;Line identifiers-&#x003E;Prefix name to labels</b> If you select this item then
     the short name of each line identifier spectrum displayed in the plot will be
     prefixed to the label. This allows you to discriminate between crowded labels.
     Note  that  the  short  name  of  a  line  identifier  can  be  modified  in  the  main
     window, once it is loaded into the global list. For legibility any names that are
     appended by <b>_lines</b>, will have that string removed and any underscores will
     be replaced by spaces.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize"><b>Options-&#x003E;Line identifiers-&#x003E;Draw horizontal labels</b> Select this option if you
                                                                                       
                                                                                       
     want line identifier labels drawn horizontally rather than vertically.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize"><b>Options-&#x003E;Line identifiers-&#x003E;Show dual sideband labels</b> Select this option if
     you want line identifier labels drawn for both sidebands of a dual sideband
     spectrum. The non-default sideband coordinates are displayed along the top
     edge of the plot and the matching labels will be displayed in red, with either
     <b>(USB)</b> or <b>(LSB)</b> postfixed to the label to avoid confusion.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize"><b>Options-&#x003E;Error  bar  auto-ranging</b>.  When  auto-ranging  a  spectrum  that  has
     associated errors the limits do not include the extent of any error bars that will
     be drawn, if you want this to be otherwise select this option.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize"><b>Options-&#x003E;Draw errors as spectrum</b>. If this option is selected and any of the
     displayed spectra have errors, then those spectra with errors will be drawn
     using the error value as each point on the line rather than the data values (and
     conversely the data values will be used to draw error bars, if that is enabled
     for any of the spectra). When displaying spectra without any errors this option
     has no effect.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize"><b>Options-&#x003E;Auto-fit percentiles in Y</b>. When this option is selected choosing a
     percentile limit in Y results in the plot also being forced to fit the height of the
     plot.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize"><b>Options-&#x003E;Short names in menu lists</b>. When this option is deselected the long
     names (usually file names) are shown in the drop-down menu.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize"><b>Options-&#x003E;Display  synopsis</b>.  When  this  option  is  selected  a  description  of

you draw an interpolated curve you can convert it into a spectrum for removing from a real spectrum
using the <b>Generate spectra from interpolated lines</b> toolbox. The types of interpolation scheme
available are:
     <div class="quote">
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">Hermite, interpolation based on Hermite polynomials. The effect is supposed
     to construct reasonable analytic curves through discrete data points (<em>i.e.</em>&#x00A0;like
     those a human would produce).
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Akima, interpolation based on Akima splines. Like Hermite this supposed to
     construct human-like analytic curves.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Cubic, interpolation using natural cubic splines.
                                                                                       
                                                                                       
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Polynomial, interpolation using a simple polynomial of order one less than the
     current number of points.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Linear, interpolation using straight-lines (like polyline, except it has sorted X
     coordinates).
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Gaussian, interpolation using a Gaussian line-profile. This can only have four
     reference positions (and is initialised from the first two indicated on the plot),
     these define the left extent, width, height/centre and right extent. The order
     will switch if these are dragged past each other (so dragging the width grip
     beyond the left extent grip will switch their meaning).
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Lorentz, interpolation using a Lorentzian line-profile. Works like the Gaussian
     curve.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Voigt, interpolation using a Voigt line-profile. This also works like the Gaussian
     curve,  but  has  five  characteristic  positions,  left  extent,  Gaussian  width,
     height/centre, Lorentzian width, right extent.
