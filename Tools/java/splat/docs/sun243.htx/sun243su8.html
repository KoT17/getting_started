<!--l. 1452--><p class="noindent" ><span class="sf">SPLAT-VO </span>&#x00A0;supports <b>DataLink</b> and <b>SODA</b> (server-side manipulation through <b>DataLink</b>). SSAP and
ObsCore services providing <b>DataLink</b> allows the user to access other resources available about the
spectrum. If the service offers <b>Datalink</b>, by right-cliking on a Spectrum from either an ObsCore or
SSAP query result list, there should be an option &#x0022;DataLink&#x0022; in the pop-up menu. When choosing this
option, a new window will open with a list of links to resources about this data. This resources could
be links to related publications, a preview image, or the dataset in other formats, or link to functions to
perform server-side operations ( <b>SODA</b>) on the data (like cutouts, normalisation, etc). If there&#x2019;s
a link to a preview image then SPLAT will automatically display it on this window. If
there are <b>SODA</b> services provided, the interactive formular to deal with the data is also
displayed.
<!--l. 1459--><p class="noindent" ><b>Server-side manipulation with DataLink/SODA</b>
<!--l. 1461--><p class="noindent" >A query response table may contain descriptions of <b>SODA</b> services, which can be either defined
specifically for single spectra, or for all of the returned spectra. In both cases an input formular will be
produced by <span class="sf">SPLAT-VO </span> where parameters can be entered. In the first case, the formular appears in
the <b>Datalink</b> resources list when right-clicking one line from the query results list. In the second case
the soda operation can be submitted one or more selected spectra at once. This is done by
clicking the Datalink button on the lower right side of the results table: After a SSAP or
ObsCore query is sent, <span class="sf">SPLAT-VO </span>&#x00A0;checks the responding servers for <b>SODA</b> definitions.
<br 
class="newline" />Table-wide <b>SODA</b> operations are present, service will be marked with a symbol (<img 
src="cutter.gif" alt="PIC"  
> ). If at least one
<b>DataLink</b> supporting server has been found, a <b>DataLink</b> button will appear below the query results.
By clicking on it, <b>DataLink</b>. will be activated, and all results tabs will be deactivated except the results
from servers that support <b>DataLink</b>. When you choose one of the active services, a window will
appear, where the respective parameters for sever-side manipulation can be entered. The parameters
will be set by clicking on the <b>set parameters</b> button. While <b>dataLink</b> is activated and the parameters
are set, the spectra you select and display or download will be manipulated using the chosen
parameters. To deactivate <b>dataLink</b> and have retrieve the original spectra just click on the <b>dataLink</b>
button again.<br

<!--l. 1467--><p class="noindent" ><b>The DataLink links window</b>
<!--l. 1470--><p class="noindent" >The <b>DataLink</b> links window is created when the Datalink option at the popup menu obtained by
right-clicking on a spectrum from either an ObsCore or SSAP query result list. It contains a table
containing all the links this available for the spectrum. The table has one row for each link, and
columns containing among other information the location, content-type, size, and semantics (what is
in this link). <br 
class="newline" />In the semantics column, <b>#this</b> means the actual spectrum, which would be displayed by <span class="sf">SPLAT-VO
</span>when clicking on the spectrum in the query results list. If a <b>#preview</b> is available, it will be
automatically displayed in the DataLink window. If there are <b>SODA</b> links (semantics <b>#proc</b>), the
respective form will also be displayed below the links table. The presence of an error message means
link is not available. <br 
class="newline" />As many of the links can contain objects in data formats <span class="sf">SPLAT-VO </span>cannot understand (and are not
necessarily spectra or timeseries), <span class="sf">SPLAT-VO </span>splat does not open all available links. If the content type
is something that <span class="sf">SPLAT-VO </span>could understand, it tries to open as a spectrum. If the content type is
<em>text/html</em>, the link will be opened in a web browser. The description column should tell if it makes
sense to click on the link to open it in <span class="sf">SPLAT-VO </span>or not. By right-clicking on a link, it&#x2019;s possible to
copy the row, or just the access url to the clipboard, which can be used to open it with other
application.
