# GPU @ SciServer

Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) are massively parallel compute units that are exceptional at running the same computation on different input data at the same time. This makes them particularly suitable for matrix and image computations, and by extension deep learning and image recognition. 

We are currently developing compute domains with GPU devices to accelerate such tasks. While this feature is not generally available publicly, we can provide demo previews and are happy to discuss your particular use case. Please contact us!
